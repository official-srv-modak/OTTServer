# OTTServer
 An OTT server that can run on any ANT based server like jboss/wildfly, tomcat, weblogic for friends and family. This is essentially a OTT server with web based interface for mobiles, computer and TV which can be used to host a local server, and all the members in that local server can access and enjoy vidoes in the local network. 
Basically idea is everyone has a hard drive lying around with pirated movies and tv shows. If one need to watch, one has to take the hard drive and then copy it to the PC and then watch which essentially reduces the concurrency and lots of time is wasted and mood is spoiled. 

So the simple solution is:- Host the server by downloading this repo, paste it in xampp (you can also do in any server configuration needs personal assistance). Edit the files path_movies.txt and path_tv.txt and give your path to movies and tv shows. Make sure the drive permissions are provided based on your OS. For mac disable SIP if you want to use the external HDD. Voila its done now use the localhost url to go the website.

Had to upload gif because github doesn't support video, so pardon the frame drops and stutters. Real app is very smooth depending upon the device
